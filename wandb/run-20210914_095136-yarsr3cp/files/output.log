C:\Users\Mark\anaconda3\envs\tf2_mgn4\lib\site-packages\torch\utils\data\_utils\collate.py:64: UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writeable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program. (Triggered internally at  ..\torch\csrc\utils\tensor_numpy.cpp:180.)
